# SoCDP8   [![Badge Hardware]][Hardware]   [![Badge Software]][Software]

This is an implementation of the 1968 **[DEC PDP-8/I]** on <br>
a **Xilinx Zynq**, a **FPGA** controller with an **ARM CPU**.

Built on the **[PiDP-8/I Console]** by **Oscar Vermeulen**, <br>
it acts as a replacement for the Raspberry Pi approach.

## Why a SoC?

Drawback of the **Raspberry Pi + Linux + SIMH** approach:

- **Inaccurate Simulation :** Doesn't allow for single stepping
- **Long Boot Times :** **Linux** takes a few seconds to boot and start **SIMH**
- **Dangerous Shutdown :** In the default Raspberry Pi setup, Linux needs a proper shutdown to avoid corrupting the file system

<br>

The **SoCDP8** implements the **PDP-8/I** in **VHDL**, targeting **FPGAs**.

<br>

#### Design

The system is modeled exactly as described in the <br>
**[Maintenance Manual]**  and **Engineering Drawings**.

*The manual is treated as the project specification, registers* <br>
*and signals are named as described in the book and register* <br>
*transfers are modeled as specified in the drawings.*

<br>

#### Peripherals

Peripherals are implemented on the **ARM CPU** on the **SoC**.

This makes device implementation such as the teletype fairly easy.

Code for peripherals can access the onboard <br>
**SD Card** to retrieve *tapes*, *disk images*, ..

When connected to the **Ethernet** / **WiFi**, the system, including <br>
its peripherals, can be controlled with a **Web Browser**.

<br>
<br>

## Project Goals

- Implementing the system as close as possible to the original specifications.

- Providing a *simple replacement* for the **Raspberry Pi**, <br>
ideally the project runs on a **SoC** board that snaps into <br>
the **PiDP-8/I Console** in the same way the **Pi** does.

- Have it be operable through a browser using <br>
a web socket connection between a web server <br>
on the **ARM** and the **PDP-8** on the **FPGA**.

<br>
<br>

## Supported SoCs

The project currently only targets the **Zynq** board <br>
and utilizes the **Pynq-Z2** for development only.

<br>

### Tested Boards

| Board |  |
|:-----:|:-|
| **[ZynqBerry]** | <br> ***Xilinx Zynq 7010*** <br><br> - `130€` \| Good Availability <br><br> - **Raspberry Pi** form factor <br><br> - No free **GPIO** pins <br><br> - Has the *smallest* **Zynq** <br><br> |
| **[Pynq-Z2]** | <br> ***Xilinx Zynq 7020*** <br><br> `132€` \| Good Availability <br><br> - Raspberry Pi Connectors <br><br> - Spare **GPIO** pins, such as a <br><br>  **PMOD** pin, useful for sensors<br> - Switches, buttons, LEDs <br><br> - Requires a ribbon cable to <br>  fit in the **PiDP-8/I** box <br><br> |

<br>

### Other Boards

| Board |  |
|:-----:|:-|
| **[DE0-Nano-SoC]** | <br> ***Altera Cyclone V*** <br><br> - `125€` \| International Shipping <br><br> - **Incompatible** 40 pin connector, <br><br>  requires adapter. <br><br> - Many free **GPIO** pins <br><br> - Switches, buttons, LEDs <br><br> |

<br>
<br>

## Project Status

<br>

### Functional

- **Base System**
- **Timesharing**
- **Data Breaks**
- **Interrupts**
- **EAE**
- **I/O**

*These features pass the **MAINDEC** tests and* <br>
*can be loaded using the **RIM** / **BIN** loaders.*
<br>
<br>

### Can Run

- `Focal69`
- `TSS/8`
- `OS/8`

<br>

### Peripherals

Implemented in software with only basic functionality.

<br>

### Deviations

To have the **PiDP-8/I** work with the **Zynq** boards, <br>
unfortunately a little modification had to be made.

The `1KΩ` resistors had to be replaced by `220Ω` ones <br>
to support the **pullup** resistance of the **Zynq** drivers.

Thankfully, `220Ω` is compatible with the **Raspberry Pi** as well so these resistors also support the original system.
